title: Building a Website
permalink: "/assignments/website/"

This assignment adapted (barely) from [the sterling model developed by Brian Croxall](http://www.briancroxall.net/s14dh/assignments/building-your-own-website/).

## Rationale

So: the internet. It’s kind of a thing, and it doesn’t appear to be going away. It is the new media of our historical moment. There are many things that are important about the internet, but most importantly for our class: the Internet is a space where writing happens. A ton of it, actually. For at least this one very important reason, learning how to make use of the internet is important, even for students working in humanities fields, and especially in the context of a writing class. You of course know how to use the internet for finding information, but you will now get some experience creating information: about yourself and your investigation of technology, literature, and new media. I have three primary goals in asking you to build your own website:

1.  Becoming facile with web publication (including managing a domain, deploying content management systems, and using HTML and CSS) is a good first step toward gaining skills you could use in your college career, co-ops, and beyond.
2.  It provides you a platform to begin doing and sharing that work with others in the academic and professional communities.
3.  It will enable you to complete [your blogging assignment](http://ryan.cordells.us/su14tlnm/assignments/blogging-assignment/ "III. Blogging Assignment") while building a portfolio of work for use after and outside this class.

## The Nitty Gritty

*   Purchase a domain from [www.reclaimhosting.com](http://www.reclaimhosting.com) and **send me an email letting me know your domain name**. _Due, 5pm on May 6._
*   [Install WordPress](http://portal.reclaimhosting.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&id=2) on your domain. _Due, 5pm on May 7._
*   Choose a new theme to install on your site and activate it. _Due, 5pm on May 8._
*   Install Akismet as a plugin. [Get an API key](http://akismet.com/) and activate it. Email me the API key. _Due, 5pm on May 9._
*   Post first blog entry for [the blogging assignment](http://ryan.cordells.us/su14tlnm/assignments/blogging-assignment/ "III. Blogging Assignment"). _Due, no later than 5pm on May 13._
*   Create an “About” page. On that page write a brief paragraph or two about yourself that includes the following information: a brief paragraph that discusses what you’re studying generally in school and what your educational / career goals are. _Due, 5pm on May 14._
*   Create one other static page about _something_. It could be where you post an assignment you do for class. It could be about a hobby. _Due, 5pm on May 16._
*   Find one thing that you wish your website could do. Find a [plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/) to do it. Install that plugin. Send me an email with the problem and the name of the plugin that fixed it. _Due, 5pm on May 20._
*   Write a three- to four-page paper in which you reflect on the build-a-website assignment. Once you’ve written that paper, [email it to me](javascript:DeCryptX('csjbo/dspybmmAfnpsz/fev')) as a PDF. And then post it to your blog. This reflection does _not_ count as one of your blog posts for the blogging assignment. _Due, 5pm on May 23._ Some questions to consider are the following:
    1.  What have I learned by building my own website and managing my own domain?
    2.  Did completing this assignment help me learn new things about writing and research in the twenty-first century?
    3.  Has “writing” myself into the world changed how I think about representing myself to others?
    4.  What would I change about this assignment to make it more relevant, informative, enjoyable, challenging, or interesting?
