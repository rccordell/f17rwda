Throughout the term, we will engage with the ideas of the course through [public writing on your blogs](http://ryan.cordells.us/su14tlnm/assignments/building-your-own-website/ "I. Building Your Own Website"), which I will aggregate on this course blog. I ask you to blog for a number of reasons:

*   All writing—even academic writing—is being reshaped by online modes of publication. Many academics maintain personal research blogs in which they try out their ideas and get feedback before developing articles or even books. Outside of academia, public, online writing plays an increasing and essential role in many fields. I believe its essential for modern college students to develop skill crafting an online writing persona and I want to foster that development.
*   In a related point, blogs give you the opportunity to experiment with your writing, composing arguments that integrate links, quotations, images, video, and other online media as evidence.
*   Blogging allows for a broader spectrum of participation in the class. Even shy students can contribute to a course blog.
*   Blog posts give you the chance to learn from each other. You'll read your colleague's writing and, hopefully, learn from it or be challenged by it.
*   Public blogging allows us to connect to larger communities outside of our classroom. Who knows? Perhaps the author of an article you blog about will respond directly…

You should not treat blog posts like a secondary assignment. Indeed, I consider your blog post the central assignment of the semester. Instead, _think of your blog posts as an evolving research paper. **They have the same importance and weight and seriousness**_.

## The Nitty-Gritty

One important detail you should pull out of Prof. Sample's guidelines: each post must begin from our course readings and demonstrate your further engagement with those readings. In general, then, your blog posts should:

1.  There are 6 units in this class and _you are responsible for writing 5 blog posts **and** commenting on 5 of your colleagues' posts_. You may not submit (for credit) more than one blog post per unit, though you're free to write more if you wish. I cannot emphasis more strongly that **you should not wait to start writing posts and commenting**. Let me repeat that: **do not wait until Unit 3 to begin writing your blog assignments**. I assign only 5 posts and 5 comments to give you some flexibility during the already-shortened summer semester; it is up to you to make that flexibility a boon rather than a bane.
2.  Blog posts are due within two days of a given unit ending. After those two days pass, I will not accept a post for a given unit.
3.  Each post must be 300-500 words long.
4.  Each post must _refer specifically to class reading, often through **direct quotation**._
_*   Your posts should continue and further develop conversations that began in class, demonstrating your evolving understanding of our class themes. I strongly encourage you to read, cite, and link to each other's posts.*   You are encouraged to bring new ideas from your own reading and research—whether for this class or from others—into dialogue with the course through your blog posts._

_

So what do I expect in your blog posts? I like this description by my colleague Mark Sample at George Mason University:

> There are a number of ways to approach these open-ended posts: consider the reading in relation to its historical or theoretical context; write about an aspect of the day’s reading that you don’t understand, or something that jars you; formulate an insightful question or two about the reading and then attempt to answer your own questions; or respond to another student’s post, building upon it, disagreeing with it, or re-thinking it.

As I hope this quote indicates, there are several angles you can take in your blog posts, but they must reflect your thought and engagement about our course readings and class discussions. Your blog posts can also bring outside texts into conversation with our class: an article you found interesting or relevant, say, or something you uncovered while researching for your final project.

### Commenting on Posts

I cannot comment on every blog post, though I or our graduate practicum student will occasionally interject when something in a post catches our attention. You should interpret such a comment as engagement, not (necessarily) sanction; conversely, you should not interpret lack of comment as criticism.

### Grading Blog Posts

Each week I will review and grade blog posts according to the following rubric, adapted by Creative Commons license (CC BY 3.0) from, again, [Mark Sample](http://www.samplereality.com/2009/08/14/pedagogy-and-the-class-blog/).

<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td valign="top" width="28">10</td>

<td valign="top" width="451">_Exceptional._ The blog post is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. The entry demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. The entry reflects in-depth engagement with the topic.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td valign="top" width="28">8</td>

<td valign="top" width="451">_Satisfactory._ The blog post is reasonably focused, and explanations or analysis are mostly based on examples or other evidence. Fewer connections are made between ideas, and though new insights are offered, they are not fully developed. The entry reflects moderate engagement with the topic.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td valign="top" width="28">6</td>

<td valign="top" width="451">_Underdeveloped._ The blog post is mostly description or summary, without consideration of alternative perspectives, and few connections are made between ideas. The entry reflects passing engagement with the topic.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td valign="top" width="28">4</td>

<td valign="top" width="451">_Limited._ The blog post is unfocused, or simply rehashes previous comments, and displays no evidence of student engagement with the topic.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td valign="top" width="28">0</td>

<td valign="top" width="451">_No Credit._ The blog post is missing or consists of one or two disconnected sentences.</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

Comments will be graded on a pass/fail basis.

### How to write for the blog

Our course website is based on Wordpress. You will create accounts with one of the graduate practicum students on the second day of class. You will receive an email with your login information. If you've never posted in Wordpress before, [visit the Wordpress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts) for instructions. You can also find useful articles here about incorporating other media into posts._
