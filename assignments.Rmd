# In-class Work and Exercises

## Assignment Overview:

+ Includes written reflections, quizzes, and/or group work
+ Students will sometimes work individually and sometimes with colleagues
+ Due during most class periods

## Details:

This course relies on active, engaged participation in class activities and discussions. There will be few lectures. You should come to every class having read all of the required texts (or watched the required videos, &c.) and prepared to discuss them with your colleagues. I plan to assess your reading and course engagement through writing exercises, reading quizzes, and group work. Assuming you all seem to be reading with engagement, I will usually ask for in-class writing or group exercises, but I reserve the right to quiz if reading seems to be slipping.

1. In-class writing

    You should be prepared to write in any class session and have appropriate materials (e.g. paper, a table, a laptop) available to you. Not all in-class writing will be collected, but when it is such work will be graded on a five-point scale. I do not expect your responses to in-class writing exercises to reflect the same polish as papers. I do expect your writing exercises to reflect real thought about our course topics and readings. Entries will receive full credit if:
    
    + They refer to specific aspects of our assigned reading. The more specific you can be, the better. For instance, if you can quote or paraphrase from a course text to illustrate the point you hope to make, you should do so.
    + They draw connections between the day’s assigned reading and the broader themes of the course, recent topics of class discussion, or your personal research.
    + They demonstrate depth of thought about the topics on hand.  
    + Writing that demonstrates a firm command of the day's reading through summarizing its ideas will receive a 4/5 while writing that *connects ideas across readings* and *ventures creative (or even risky) interpretations* will receive 5/5. Lower marks are reserved for writing that does not demonstrate familiarity with the day's readings, fails to address the prompt, and/or lacks clarity.

2. Individual and Group Work

    In addition to discussion of course texts, our classes will frequently ask you to complete small projects and exercises that will help you apply course concepts, learn new software, and contextualize course materials. For group exercises, I will ask each group member to assume a specific task related to the project; I expect each group member to contribute in significant ways to their team’s effort. The outcome of group work will be various and thus will be assessed in diverse ways.

3. Reading quizzes

    I prefer not to resort to reading quizzes, which test basic comprehension rather than synthesis and analysis. However, if it becomes clear that significant portions of the class are not completing the readings (which will be obvious by the resultant lulls in conversation) then I reserve the right to begin quizzing. Reading quizzes are intended to reward careful reading, not to test your comprehension of obscure facts from our texts. If you read the assigned texts attentively—if you read the assigned texts attentively—you should do well on the quizzes. Each quiz will have six questions; if you correctly answer five of them you will receive full credit, while all six garners extra credit.
    
# Build Your Own Website

This assignment adapted (barely) from [the sterling model developed by Brian Croxall](http://www.briancroxall.net/s14dh/assignments/building-your-own-website/).

## Rationale

So: the internet. It’s kind of a thing, and it doesn’t appear to be going away. It is the new media of our historical moment. There are many things that are important about the internet, but most importantly for our class: the Internet is a space where writing happens. A ton of it, actually. For at least this one very important reason, learning how to make use of the internet is important, even for students working in humanities fields, and especially in the context of a writing class. You of course know how to use the internet for finding information, but you will now get some experience creating information: about yourself and your investigation of technology, literature, and new media. I have three primary goals in asking you to build your own website:

1.  Becoming facile with web publication (including managing a domain, deploying content management systems, and using HTML and CSS) is a good first step toward gaining skills you could use in your college career, co-ops, and beyond.
2.  It provides you a platform to begin doing and sharing that work with others in the academic and professional communities.
3.  It will enable you to complete [your blogging assignment](http://ryan.cordells.us/su14tlnm/assignments/blogging-assignment/ "III. Blogging Assignment") while building a portfolio of work for use after and outside this class.

## The Nitty Gritty

*   Purchase a domain from [www.reclaimhosting.com](http://www.reclaimhosting.com) and **send me an email letting me know your domain name**. _Due, 5pm on May 6._
*   [Install WordPress](http://portal.reclaimhosting.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&id=2) on your domain. _Due, 5pm on May 7._
*   Choose a new theme to install on your site and activate it. _Due, 5pm on May 8._
*   Install Akismet as a plugin. [Get an API key](http://akismet.com/) and activate it. Email me the API key. _Due, 5pm on May 9._
*   Post first blog entry for [the blogging assignment](http://ryan.cordells.us/su14tlnm/assignments/blogging-assignment/ "III. Blogging Assignment"). _Due, no later than 5pm on May 13._
*   Create an “About” page. On that page write a brief paragraph or two about yourself that includes the following information: a brief paragraph that discusses what you’re studying generally in school and what your educational / career goals are. _Due, 5pm on May 14._
*   Create one other static page about _something_. It could be where you post an assignment you do for class. It could be about a hobby. _Due, 5pm on May 16._
*   Find one thing that you wish your website could do. Find a [plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/) to do it. Install that plugin. Send me an email with the problem and the name of the plugin that fixed it. _Due, 5pm on May 20._
*   Write a three- to four-page paper in which you reflect on the build-a-website assignment. Once you’ve written that paper, [email it to me](javascript:DeCryptX('csjbo/dspybmmAfnpsz/fev')) as a PDF. And then post it to your blog. This reflection does _not_ count as one of your blog posts for the blogging assignment. _Due, 5pm on May 23._ Some questions to consider are the following:
    1.  What have I learned by building my own website and managing my own domain?
    2.  Did completing this assignment help me learn new things about writing and research in the twenty-first century?
    3.  Has “writing” myself into the world changed how I think about representing myself to others?
    4.  What would I change about this assignment to make it more relevant, informative, enjoyable, challenging, or interesting?
    
# Blogging

## Rationale 

Throughout the term, we will engage with the ideas of the course through public writing on your blogs, which I will aggregate on this course blog. I ask you to blog for a number of reasons:

+ All writing—even academic writing—is being reshaped by online modes of publication. Many academics maintain personal research blogs in which they try out their ideas and get feedback before developing articles or even books. Outside of academia, public, online writing plays an increasing and essential role in many fields. I believe its essential for modern college students to develop skill crafting an online writing persona and I want to foster that development.
+ In a related point, blogs give you the opportunity to experiment with your writing, composing arguments that integrate links, quotations, images, video, and other online media as evidence.
+ Blogging allows for a broader spectrum of participation in the class. Even shy students can contribute to a course blog.
+ Blog posts give you the chance to learn from each other. You'll read your colleague's writing and, hopefully, learn from it or be challenged by it.
+ Public blogging allows us to connect to larger communities outside of our classroom. Who knows? Perhaps the author of an article you blog about will respond directly…

You should not treat blog posts like a secondary assignment. Indeed, I consider your blog post the central assignment of the semester. Instead, _think of your blog posts as an evolving research paper. **They have the same importance and weight and seriousness**_.

## The Nitty-Gritty

One important detail you should pull out of Prof. Sample's guidelines: each post must begin from our course readings and demonstrate your further engagement with those readings. In general, then, your blog posts should:

1.  There are 6 units in this class and _you are responsible for writing 5 blog posts **and** commenting on 5 of your colleagues' posts_. You may not submit (for credit) more than one blog post per unit, though you're free to write more if you wish. I cannot emphasis more strongly that **you should not wait to start writing posts and commenting**. Let me repeat that: **do not wait until Unit 3 to begin writing your blog assignments**. I assign only 5 posts and 5 comments to give you some flexibility during the already-shortened summer semester; it is up to you to make that flexibility a boon rather than a bane.
2.  Blog posts are due within two days of a given unit ending. After those two days pass, I will not accept a post for a given unit.
3.  Each post must be 300-500 words long.
4.  Each post must _refer specifically to class reading, often through **direct quotation**._
_*   Your posts should continue and further develop conversations that began in class, demonstrating your evolving understanding of our class themes. I strongly encourage you to read, cite, and link to each other's posts.*   You are encouraged to bring new ideas from your own reading and research—whether for this class or from others—into dialogue with the course through your blog posts._

So what do I expect in your blog posts? I like this description by my colleague Mark Sample at George Mason University:

> There are a number of ways to approach these open-ended posts: consider the reading in relation to its historical or theoretical context; write about an aspect of the day’s reading that you don’t understand, or something that jars you; formulate an insightful question or two about the reading and then attempt to answer your own questions; or respond to another student’s post, building upon it, disagreeing with it, or re-thinking it.

As I hope this quote indicates, there are several angles you can take in your blog posts, but they must reflect your thought and engagement about our course readings and class discussions. Your blog posts can also bring outside texts into conversation with our class: an article you found interesting or relevant, say, or something you uncovered while researching for your final project.

### Commenting on Posts

I cannot comment on every blog post, though I or our graduate practicum student will occasionally interject when something in a post catches our attention. You should interpret such a comment as engagement, not (necessarily) sanction; conversely, you should not interpret lack of comment as criticism.

### Grading Blog Posts

Each week I will review and grade blog posts according to the following rubric, adapted by Creative Commons license (CC BY 3.0) from, again, [Mark Sample](http://www.samplereality.com/2009/08/14/pedagogy-and-the-class-blog/).

| _Exceptional._ | _Satisfactory._ | _Underdeveloped._ | _Limited._ | _No Credit._ |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| The blog post is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. The entry demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. The entry reflects in-depth engagement with the topic. | The blog post is reasonably focused, and explanations or analysis are mostly based on examples or other evidence. Fewer connections are made between ideas, and though new insights are offered, they are not fully developed. The entry reflects moderate engagement with the topic. | The blog post is mostly description or summary, without consideration of alternative perspectives, and few connections are made between ideas. The entry reflects passing engagement with the topic. | The blog post is unfocused, or simply rehashes previous comments, and displays no evidence of student engagement with the topic. | The blog post is missing or consists of one or two disconnected sentences.|

Comments will be graded on a pass/fail basis.

### How to write for the blog

Our course website is based on Wordpress. You will create accounts with one of the graduate practicum students on the second day of class. You will receive an email with your login information. If you've never posted in Wordpress before, [visit the Wordpress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts) for instructions. You can also find useful articles here about incorporating other media into posts.

# No Digital Day

This assignment isn't due until June 11, but it requires a bit of planning and so I wanted it up from the beginning of class. The assignment is lightly adapted from Prof. Amanda Gailey's "No Digital Day" assignment for her ["Being Human in a Digital Age"](http://segonku.unl.edu/beinghuman/) course at the University of Nebraska—Lincoln.

[![cavemen](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5525/10976351175_9f8721d797_h.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/akrockefeller/10976351175/sizes/h/)  
_Hour 8: “The sad thing is, I can’t even picture my iPhone’s face anymore.”_

## Rationale

Human beings have interacted with illuminated screens for a portion of the species’ existence that is so small it’s hard to calculate as a percentage. If humans have existed for 200,00 years, we’ve used screens for about 0.05% of that time. A stricter definition of “human,” requiring symbolic thought, etc., would make the species 50,000 years old, in which case screens have been familiar for about 0.2% of our existence. Should we feel so cognitively dependent on them now? What does your brain do without the distraction and convenience of the screen?

Sometime between May 28 and June 10, you will pick a single 24-hour period—which must include an entire waking day—in which you will dramatically reduce your use of screen-based technology and interactive media, according to guidelines below. This activity is meant to encourage you to think about a few things:

+ How cognitively dependent are you on certain technologies?
+ How frequently are you tempted to distract yourself with various digital technologies? What triggers prompt you to want to distract yourself? Without familiar devices, what do you do instead? What do you think about or do with your hands?
+ How much do these technologies aid you in your schoolwork?
+ How do you communicate differently with people when these technologies are not available to you?
+ What do you do for entertainment?

Each student may pick from the following choices, depending on how austere you want to be.

### Option A: 1992 

Just before the web became widely available. You probably would have had a phone at home, cable TV, and a word processor. If you choose this option, the following are not allowed:

*   Texting
*   Web browsing
*   Any use of your phone as something besides a phone—that is, you can dial a number and talk to someone, but that’s it. Realistically, you wouldn’t have carried a phone around with you, but you can do that as long as you only use it as a phone.
*   GPS
*   Streaming video
*   Streaming music, MP3s, etc.
*   Online video games, even through a console

### Option B: 1922

Before most screen-based and communication technologies we use today were developed or in wide use. If you choose this option, the following are not allowed:

*   Any use of phones whatsoever, except for true emergencies (death, injury, natural disaster)
*   Any use of any web-based technology
*   Any use of any screen-based devices, television included

### A Note on Honesty

Your job is to remain true to the spirit of this assignment. You aren’t expected to dress like a turn-of-the-century dandy or avoid refrigerators—the point is to eliminate the kinds of recent technological advances that arguably lead to cognitive dependence and an alteration of your thinking. Similarly, there are many ways you could violate the spirit of the assignment, such as having a friend look up information for you. I trust you to use your judgment about what violates the spirit of the assignment.

This assignment also depends on the honor system. I’m not interested in policing you to make sure you really did this. It’s an exercise in self-awareness and you’re really cheating yourself by cheating on the assignment. If you can’t go 24 hours without a few modern conveniences, is it time to admit your cognitive dependence?

## To Prepare

1.  Think ahead when picking your 24-hour period. If you need to get syllabi or assignments off the web, do it ahead of time. If our class falls during your 24-hour period, make sure to print out any readings or other required online materials before the day begins.
2.  Consider writing a vacation response for your email and changing your voicemail so that you won’t worry that people are wondering why you haven’t written or called back.
3.  If there are people in your life who will worry about you if they don’t hear from you, let them know what you’re doing ahead of time.
4.  Get a watch (or at least scope out working clocks in your environment). Phones in 1992 did not have clocks in them.
5.  Be aware of how to reach people by phone. You’ll need a phone book or you’ll need to write numbers down ahead of time.

## On the Day

1.  Carry a notebook and pen with you. Whenever you feel tempted to check your email or social media, make a check mark in the book.
2.  Take notes on your thought process. What triggers you to seek distraction? What do you do instead?
3.  Take notes on other aspects of the day. In what ways were you inconvenienced? Did this assignment alter the way you interact with people you care about?

## By TBD

Write a reflection on your No Digital Day. What did you learn about yourself? Would you do this again or for a longer period of time? In a final act of irony, post it to our class blog. (Everyone is required to do this one.)

# Unessay

## Assignment Overview:

+ Form can vary *widely!!*
+ Students generally work individually, though I am open to collaborative proposals. 
+ Unessay 1 due Monday, February 20 by 8pm
+ Unessay 2 due Monday, April 17 by 8pm

## Details: 

Twice during the semester you will develop an unessay project.

1. I *highly prize* creative takes on this assignment. Before jumping into typical paper writing mode, consider other media, presentation styles, and modes of critical engagement you might employ instead.
2. This is a hands-on course about media and technology: I would be thrilled to see unessays that do rather than simply describe. Consider using your unessay assignment to get your hands dirty (perhaps literally) with one of the mediums we discuss in class.
3. Take advantage of my advice and help as you develop your unessay ideas. That's what I'm here for!

You may complete your unessays on your own schedule, but it must be turned in by Monday, February 20. I would strongly advise you not to put the assignment off. To motivate you to work earlier, I am happy to review, comment on, and allow revisions for any unessays turned in at least two weeks before the February 20 deadline. Your final unessay will be due by 8pm on Monday April 17. In that case, too, I would be happy to review, comment on, and allow revisions of unessay projects submitted in advance of that final deadline. 

I will also show you some stellar examples of unessays in the weeks leading up to the first deadline, and would be happy to show you others during office hours. I have a growing collection of stunning student unessay work that I love revisiting.

### Assignment Background

Thanks to Daniel Paul O’Donnell for [this brilliant assignment](http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay), which I’ve only slightly modified for our class. For more on the research behind the Unessay assignment, see [the work of Emma Dering and Matthew Galea](http://dpod.kakelbont.ca/category/research/unessay/).

The essay is a wonderful and flexible tool for engaging with a topic intellectually. It is a very free format that can be turned to discuss any topic—works of literature, of course, but also autobiography, science, entertainment, history, and government, politics, and so on. There is often something provisional about the essay (its name comes from French essai, meaning a trial), and almost always something personal.

Unfortunately, however, [as Wikipedia notes](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Essay&oldid=510540710),

> In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal education. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills, and admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants and, in the humanities and social sciences, as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.

One result of this is that the essay form, which should be extremely free and flexible, is instead often presented as a static and rule-bound monster that students must master in order not to lose marks (for a vigorous defence of the flexible essay, see software developer Paul Graham’s blog). Far from an opportunity to explore intellectual passions and interests in a personal style, the essay is transformed into a formulaic method for discussing set topics in five paragraphs: the compulsory figures of academia.

### Enter the Unessay

By contrast, the unessay is an assignment that attempts to undo the damage done by this approach to teaching writing. It works by throwing out all the rules you have learned about essay writing in the course of your primary, secondary, and post secondary education and asks you to focus instead solely on your intellectual interests and passions. In an unessay you choose your own topic, present it any way you please, and are evaluated on how compelling and effective you are. Here are the guidelines:

1. You choose your own topic

    The unessay allows you to write about anything you want provided you are able to associate your topic with the subject matter of the course and unit we are working on. You can take any approach; you can use as few or as many resources as you wish; you can even cite the Wikipedia. The only requirements are that your treatment of the topic be *compelling*: that is to say presented in a way that leaves the reader thinking that you are being accurate, interesting, and as complete and/or convincing as your subject allows.

2. You can present it any way you please

    There are also no formal requirements. Your unessay can be written in five paragraphs or twenty-six. If you decide you need to cite something, you can do that anyway you want. If you want to use lists, use lists. If you want to write in the first person, write in the first person. If you prefer to present the whole thing as a video, present it as a video. Use slang. Or don’t. Write in sentence fragments if you think that would be effective. In other words, in an unessay you have complete freedom of form: you can use whatever style of writing, presentation, citation, or media you want. What is important is that the format and presentation you do use helps rather than hinders your explanation of the topic.
    
    Perhaps most importantly, the unessay allows you to use media deliberately and thoughtfully. You can create a digital unessay, or you can create an analog project. Do you want to think through letterpress using letterpress? This assignment encourages you to do just that. 

3. Be evaluated on how compelling and effective you are

    If unessays can be about anything and there are no restrictions on format and presentation, how are they graded? The main criteria is how well it all fits together. That is to say, how *compelling* and *effective* your work is.
    
An unessay is compelling when it shows some combination of the following:
    
+ it is as interesting as its topic and approach allows
+ it is as complete as its topic and approach allows (it doesn’t leave the audience thinking that important points are being skipped over or ignored)
+ it is truthful (any questions, evidence, conclusions, or arguments you raise are honestly and accurately presented)  
    
In terms of presentation, an unessay is effective when it shows some combination of these attributes:
   
+ it is readable/watchable/listenable (i.e. the production values are appropriately high and the audience is not distracted by avoidable lapses in presentation)
+ it is appropriate (i.e. it uses a format and medium that suits its topic and approach)
+ it is attractive (i.e. it is presented in a way that leads the audience to trust the author and his or her arguments, examples, and conclusions).

### Why Unessays Are Not a Waste of Your Time

The unessay may be quite different from what you are used to doing in English class. If so, a reasonable question might be whether I am wasting your time by assigning them. If you can write whatever you want and present it any way you wish, is this not going to be a lot easier to do than an actual essay? And is it not leaving you unprepared for subsequent instructors who want you to right the real kind of essays?

The answer to both these questions is no. Unessays are not going to be easier than “real” essays. There have fewer rules to remember and worry about violating (actually there are none). But unessays are more challenging in that you need to make your own decisions about what you are going to discuss and how you are going to discuss it.

And you are not going to be left unprepared for instructors who assign “real” essays. Questions like how to format your page or prepare a works-cited list are actually quite trivial and easily learned. You can look them up when you need to know them and, increasingly, can get your software to handle these things for you anyway. In our class, moreover, I will be giving you separate instruction on what English professors normally expect to see in the essays you submit to them.

But even more importantly, the things you will be doing in an unessay will help improve your “real” ones: excellent “real” essays also match form to topic and are about things you are interested in; if you learn how to write compelling and effective unessays, you’ll find it a lot easier to do well in your “real” essays as well.

## Model Unessays

I will bring some physical model unessays to class to discuss, or you can peruse them during office hours. Below are some fantastic digital unessays that students have submitted. These examples don’t necessarily model the *content* of your assignments, as some were completed for classes covering very different topics, but hopefully they will give you a sense of what kinds of work you might complete.
