## A few housekeeping matters

1. First blog posts due by this Friday. If you're having trouble with your websites come see me. (briefly discuss what makes a good blog)
2. First paper workshop is one week from Wednesday. I've added a brief prompt to the assignment page. (discuss what they should be thinking planning their paper. Could build on idea from their first blog posts)

## Story Time!

--Is this a book? How so? How not? Does that identification matter?

## Group Exercise

Opening group exercise from "Massively Open": "Does it matter that if you wanted to, you actually could taste the printed books in the library?" As a group, brainstorm reasons why this fact might matter, and reasons why it might not. Draw from both of our readings this week, your own personal experiences, and any related materials you might be familiar with from outside of this class.

### My followup questions for discussion
+ can you *not* taste a Kindle (if you wanted to)?
+ what idea of "the book" does that question require (that it is printed pages bound in covers)?
+ the real distinction might be between *the* individual *books*, which might each taste slightly different, and one device for all the books, which would taste the same each time. Does that distinction matter? In what ways might it matter? It what ways does it not?

## Group Discussion

## Demonstrate Hypothes.is

+ Lots of online reading in this class
+ Need to stay engaged; not skim and treat lightly as is described in the *Scientific American* article from today's reading
+ Active annotation is one strategy for deep, engaged online reading
