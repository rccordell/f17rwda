# Opening Prompt

In their article, "The Algorithmic Experience: *Portal* as Art," Burden and Gouglas write that, to be considered art, "New artifacts require at least some genetic legacy to earlier generations of critical discourse." In other words, to think of some creation as art, we need to be able to connect it, at least in part, to the frameworks and paradigms used to understand prior forms of art "Reading and Writing in the Digital Age" is not an art course, but a literature course, so let's look back towards literature, specifically. Can we understand, at least in part, a game like *Portal* through the vocabulary, intellectual frameworks, or theories we use to understand written genres like novels, poems, or plays? Are there any "literary" ideas that seem particularly useful for approaching video games? To ask the question more broadly: are video games literature? Why or why not?
