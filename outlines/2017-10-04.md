## Bots Day



### Questions for Discussion

 
1. What political point(s) does your bot seem designed to make?
2. How does the bot work? What are its data sources and what does it do with them?
3. Who might be paying attention to this bot? Who is the audience, and how do you expect they react to this bot?
4. Do you see bots like this one as distinct from those spreading fake news, for instance, or as similar? What implications might your answer hold for how we should think of these kinds of algorithmic cultural objects?
5. To draw on our "How to Thing About Bots" article, who is responsible for what your bot tweets and why?
