## Opening Prompt

1. Think about your own digital reading experiences, whether on your computer, your phone, or dedicated devices like the Kindle. In what ways have your experiences resembled those described by La Farge or Mod? Cite specific claims from their text to talk about how your experiences either resemble or differ from what they describe. Be as precise as you can about specific reading interactions, rather than broad generalizations. You'll be turning this in to me.

## Discussion of readings

## Group activity

In your group, I want you to wireframe a better digital reading interface. You can think about the hardware and the software. What elements would an interface need to create an effective reading environment for you? Feel free to be speculative here: the technology you describe doesn't need to already exist.
