## 1. Group Work Prompt

Toward the beginning of her article, ["Escape the Matrix,"](https://www.wired.com/2017/08/uncanny-valley-internet/) Virginia Heffernan claims that a central problem facing us when trying to grapple with the changes brought on by the internet is that of metaphor:

> The cycle of doubt and self-doubt—bitcoin sounds fishy; I’m an idiot for thinking bitcoin sounded fishy—can turn palpable, somatic. And that’s when it starts to seem clear that what we’re doing with software is not just interacting with machines, something our emotionally detached left brains can deal with. What we’re doing still, after all these years, is seeking serviceable metaphors that will make sense of the digital onslaught, trying to match its many facets, in scale and tenor, with traditional human experiences.
>
> Of course, every metaphor carries its own baggage. For example, maybe bitcoin is “money.” Money surfaces all the emotional chaos surrounding credit, debt, thrift, riches, banks, bankruptcy. Or maybe bitcoin is a weapon, or cult esoterica. Maybe it’s the dark internet or benign nonsense. With any of those hypotheses comes a set of associations, aversions, even attractions. At the same time, metaphors are poor things that never adequately illuminate the things they stand in for. We’re practiced in the old connections from glittery gold to paper dollars to all that money connotes, but connecting bitcoin (which I defy any reader to clearly picture) to good old coins, the minted ingots used by our grandpas and ancient Romans alike, is a taxing mental operation.

This recalls the idea of the skeuomorph that we discussed many weeks ago: the symbolic and linguistic metaphors drawn from older media that we use to understand newer media. Recall, for instance, our discussion of the iPhone's voicemail icon, which recalls the cassette tape reels used by early answering machines, or the save icon of a floppy disk, hardware no one uses to save anything anymore. 

Once you start looking for them, visual skeuomorphs are relatively easy to identify (provided you know their historical referents). The conceptual skeuomorphs Heffernan discusses—e.g. is bitcoin really "money," or is it something else altogether?—are perhaps harder to pinpoint. But that harder work is precisely what I want you to do in your groups today. Working together, identify 2-3 specific metaphors of internet culture and/or technologies that fail to adequately convey the new paradigms they describe. It may be that the metaphors fail to convey a realistic sense of how the technologies operate, or fail to convey the political-social effects from the technologies. 

In your groups, you should outline 1. what the skeuomorphic metaphors are, 2. why the historical referent fails to fully describe the contemporary technology, and 3. what consequences stem from that failed metaphor.

## 3. Complication

Introduce "American Nazi" article—how does the internet creep into "real life?" Do these kinds of eruptions complicate the conclusions of Heffernan's piece?
