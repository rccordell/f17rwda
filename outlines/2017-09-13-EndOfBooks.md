## A few housekeeping matters

1. Only one of you has sent their website thus far. Remember those first blog posts are due by Friday, and you'll need to email me to show that the first steps of the Domain of One's Own have been completed
2. Paper ideas: anything yet?
3. I travel this weekend, leaving immediately after class tomorrow. If you have questions now is the time!


## Story Time!

+ "Read" *The Pedlar Woman of Gushing Cross* to the class
+ How might we understand an artifact like this one using Octave Uzanne's "The End of Books?"
