# Dear Data Discussion

Have each student share the examples they chose

1. What did you find interesting about this data visualization?
2. What did you find difficult to understand about it?
3. Can you imagine an improvement for it?


# Dear (My) Data Planning

1. Look together at some of the sample cards in the postcard kit
2. Divide into pairs
3. Each pair should choose some aspect of their day-to-day lives they think might make an interesting visualization
4. Then they should sketch out a few ideas about how to visualize it
