# Writing Prompt: Deadly Metadata

Together we will watch a short video clip of retired General Michael Hayden, the former director of the NSA and the CIA. Hayden is responding to a quote from NSA General Counsel Stewart Baker, who said said, “metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life. If you have enough metadata, you don’t really need content.” Hayen agrees and notes, "We kill people based on metadata."

Keeping in my three recent assigned texts—the *99% Invisible* episode on "weapons of math destruction," Alexis Madrigal's piece on Netflix, and our story for today, Naomi Kritzer's "Cat Pictures Please," reflect on General Hayden's statement. What kind of metadata do you think he is talking about? How might that metadata prompt such decisive military/intelligence action? Is metadata sufficient for making such decisions? Why or why not?
