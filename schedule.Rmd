*["Reading Book Study Student," by ThoroughlyReviewed](https://thoroughlyreviewed.com)*

*Note: this will be an unusually busy travel semester for me. I've tried to indicate on the schedule when I will be traveling. Not all of these trips will affect class itself. I've tried to minimize cancellations and develop alternative activities for those days I cannot avoid missing. However, traveling might affect my responsiveness to email and so forth. I will strive to answer emails in a timely fashion, but if you do write while I am away from town please allow an extra half day or so before worrying about a lack of response.*

-----

Most of the texts we will use in this class are freely available online, or in [the course packet](https://github.com/rccordell/f17rwda/blob/master/data/rwda-coursepacket.zip) (I will give you the password for this zip file in class). See the [the policies page](http://f17rwda.ryancordell.org/policies.html) for the few texts that must be purchased.
